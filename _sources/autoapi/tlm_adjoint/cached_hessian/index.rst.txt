---------------

.. py:class:: CachedHessian(J, *, manager=None, cache_adjoint=True)




   
   Represents a Hessian associated with a given forward. Uses a cached
   forward calculation.


   :Parameters:

       **J** : variable
           Defines the functional.

       **manager** : :class:`.EquationManager`
           The :class:`.EquationManager` used to record the forward. Must have
           recorded the forward calculation with `'memory'` checkpointing,
           with automatic dropping of variable references disabled. `manager()` is
           used if not supplied.

       **cache_adjoint** : bool
           Whether to cache the first order adjoint.

   .. py:method:: action(M, dM, M0=None)

      
      As described in :meth:`.Hessian.action`, using a cached forward
      calculation.











      .. warning::

          `M` defines the control, but does not define its value. The value of
          the control used is as for the recorded forward calculation. `M0` is
          unused.

.. py:class:: CachedGaussNewton(X, R_inv_action, B_inv_action=None, *, manager=None)




   
   Represents a Gauss-Newton approximation to a Hessian associated with a
   given forward. Uses a cached forward calculation.


   :Parameters:

       **X** : variable or Sequence[variable, ...]
           Defines the state.

       **R_inv_action** : callable
           See :class:`.GaussNewton`.

       **B_inv_action** : callable
           See :class:`.GaussNewton`.

       **manager** : :class:`.EquationManager`
           The :class:`.EquationManager` used to record the forward. Must have
           recorded the forward calculation with `'memory'` checkpointing,
           with automatic dropping of variable references disabled. `manager()` is
           used if not supplied.
