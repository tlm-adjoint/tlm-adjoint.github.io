.. py:class:: PeriodicDiskCheckpointSchedule(period)




   
   A checkpointing schedule where forward restart checkpoints are stored
   periodically to disk. Non-linear dependency data is recomputed for use by
   the adjoint by re-running the forward from these checkpoints. If the
   storage period is greater than one then non-linear dependency data for
   multiple steps is recomputed and stored when advancing the adjoint.

   Online, unlimited adjoint calculations permitted.

   :arg period: Forward restart checkpoints are stored to disk every `period`
       forward steps in the initial forward calculation.

   .. py:property:: is_exhausted

      
      Whether the schedule has concluded. Note that some schedules permit
      multiple adjoint calculation, and may never conclude.

   .. py:property:: uses_disk_storage

      
      Whether the schedule may use disk storage. If `False` then no disk
      storage is required.

   .. py:method:: iter()

      
      A generator which should be overridden in derived classes in order
      to define a checkpointing schedule.
