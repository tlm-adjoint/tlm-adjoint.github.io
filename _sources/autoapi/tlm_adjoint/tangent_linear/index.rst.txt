.. py:class:: TangentLinearMap(M, dM)


   
   Defines a map from forward variables to associated tangent-linear
   variables.

   The map is used via e.g.

   .. code-block:: python

       tau_x = tlm_map[x]

   where `x` is a forward variable.

       - If `x` defines a component of the control, then `tau_x` is a variable
         defining the associated component of the direction.
       - If `x` does not define a component of the control and is not
         'static', then `tau_x` is a tangent-linear variable. A new variable
         is instantiated if needed.
       - Otherwise `tau_x` is `None`, indicating that the tangent-linear
         variable is zero.

   Containment can be tested

   .. code-block:: python

       if x in tlm_map:
           [...]

   and returns `True` if `x` defines a component of the control, or a
   tangent-linear variable associated with `x` has been instantiated.

   :arg M: A variable or :class:`Sequence` of variables defining the control.
   :arg dM: A variable or :class:`Sequence` of variables defining the
       derivative direction. The tangent-linear computes directional
       derivatives with respect to the control defined by `M` and with
       direction defined by `dM`.
